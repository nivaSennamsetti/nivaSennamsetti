# 👋 Hi, I'm Nivas Sennamsetti

I'm into finance, Python, and building tools that turn data into insight.

### 🧠 What I'm Building:
- Insider Trading Heatmap → tracking SEC Form 4s in real-time
- Financial NLP projects — sentiment extraction from 10-Ks and earnings calls
- “Portfolio Autopsy” tool — identify why a portfolio outperformed or underperformed

### 🚀 Next Up:
- Backtesting mini-framework in Python
- Interactive dashboards using Streamlit
